Write a method that takes an Array of numbers and then returns the
sum of the sums of each leading subsequence for that Array.
You may assume that the Array always contains at least one number.

Examples:

sum_of_sums([3, 5, 2]) == (3) + (3 + 5) + (3 + 5 + 2) # -> (21)
sum_of_sums([1, 5, 7, 3]) == (1) + (1 + 5) + (1 + 5 + 7) + (1 + 5 + 7 + 3) # -> (36)
sum_of_sums([4]) == 4
sum_of_sums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 35

First I am going to read through the problem a few times and understand the test cases provided. Then I am going
deconstruct the problem into its requirements and define the rules and boundaries of the problem.

Now I am going to go through the test cases in more detail and map out the high level sequence of manual steps
involved in going from the input to the output
