A double number is a number with an even number of digits whose left-side digits are
exactly the same as its right-side digits. For example, 44, 3333, 103103, 7676 are all double numbers. 
444, 334433, and 107 are not.

Write a method that returns 2 times the number provided as an argument, 
unless the argument is a double number; double numbers should be returned as-is.

Examples:

Copy Code
twice(37) == 74
twice(44) == 44
twice(334433) == 668866
twice(444) == 888
twice(107) == 214
twice(103103) == 103103
twice(3333) == 3333
twice(7676) == 7676
twice(123_456_789_123_456_789) == 123_456_789_123_456_789
twice(5) == 10


First I am going to read through the problem a few times and understand the test cases provided. Then I am going
deconstruct the problem into its requirements and define the rules and boundaries of the problem.

Now I am going to go through the test cases in more detail and map out the high level sequence of manual steps
involved in going from the input to the output
