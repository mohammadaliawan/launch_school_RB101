## Understanding the Problem

### Make the Inputs, Outputs & Process Explicit

#### Break Down (Inputs, Outputs,and Process)

- Break it down into pieces. 
- Make all the requirements and rules regarding the input/Output/ Process explicit.
- Any special Datastructure requirements. e.g input will be an array.
- Are there any implicit requirements. Implied ones? Make them explicit.
- Dont make assumptions. Ask questions.
- Are there any examples? Note down any implicit requirements from examples. Use computational words e.g. Given this, required this, output this.
- Is there any implied knowledge? e,g use st, rd as appropriate. How are you going to decide what's appropraite here? **Capture that implied knowledge in computational language.**
- Are there any special terms that need further explaination with regards to the problem domain? 
  - Terms with Multiple meanings? What meaning is implied for this problem domain?
  - Terms unfamiliar to you? Define them explicitly.


##### Input Pieces and Requirements/Rules/Terms Definiitons



##### Output Pieces and Requirements/Rules/Terms Definiitons



##### Input -> Output Process Requirements/Rules/Terms Definiitons



### Mental Model for the Probelm

- Mental Models are an explaination of my thought process about how somethings works.

- My summary view of the entire problem; my perspective of what the problem requries:

## Examples/ Test cases

These help you understand the problem better and allow you to verify your solution.

Sometimes the problem statement already provides a set of examples and test cases. Dont rely on them as your as your entire set of examples. Always think about what other conditions I have to handle. 
Write down your own examples and test cases as well to cover other scenarios.

### Input / Output Examples - from rules / requirements; the "obvious" results

Given this input, what will be the output:

**input/output**








### Input / Output Examples - Edge Cases

These examples and test cases allow you to come up with appropriate solutions to cases that could be mishandled by your program.

**Remember to Focus on the input** And **ASK QUESTIONS TO CLARIFY**

#### Emptiness : nil, null, "", [], {}


#### Large, Small, Few, Many, 0, 1, Floating points, Integers etc


#### Boundary Conditions

Where do the rquirements change:
Limits to the input;



#### Repetition, Duplication



#### Uppercase/ Lowercase



#### Failures/ Bad inputs

- What kind of Bad inputs can be there? Inputs that will raise exceptions or errors?

- How to handle them?
  - Raise exceptions?
  - Report Errors- Exception Handling
  - Return a value e.g. 0, "", [], nil, null etc.
