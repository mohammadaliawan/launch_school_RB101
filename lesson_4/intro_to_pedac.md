# Introduction to PEDAC


PEDAC is one approach to solving programming problems.

Identify and avoid pitfalls.

P Understand the Problem

E Examples/Test Cases

D Data Structures

A Algorithm

C Code


## Why use PEDAC

Helps you save time and lets you solve **complex** problems effiiciently.

## P - Understanding the Problem- Making the Problem and required solution crystal clear.

Three Steps:

1. Read the Problem Description Multiple Times
2. Check the Test Cases
3. Verify all your assumptions either from the test cases or If any part of the problem is unclear, ask the interviewer. Dont Make Assumptions. Clarify Everything you can think of.

If you can't determine the answer with the test cases or problem description, you should ask the interviewer to clarify this for you.

### Output of this Step:

Input:
Output:

Rules:

Explicit: Problem statement


Implicit: Check test cases, ask interviewer

## DataStructure / Algorithm

Data Structures Influence your Algorithm.

The biggest problem students have is when providing sufficient detail when writing algorithm.


### Algorithm Approach:

After selecting your data structures:

1. Write a high level algorithm in simple english
2. write out the psuedocode for the main method with SUBPROCESSES
2. Next write out the main skeleton of the method

3. Then go into a little more detail for the hardest step first in the algo
4. Wrtie the pseudocode for this step
5. Code this step and test

6. repeat steps 3,4,5
