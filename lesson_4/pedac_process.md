# The PEDAC Process

All the steps in this process are about understanding the problem

## P: Understanding the Problem

Helps to establish a frame of reference for understanding the problem and determining a solution.

- Establish the Rules/ Define the boundaries of the problem
  - Examine and analyze any and all the information available to us about the problem.
  - Restate the problem in a different format.
  - Extracting elements of the problem description into a set of rules or requirements.
  - Explicit Rules: clearly stated
  - Implicit Rules: not stated, can be extrapolated from examples, test cases, problem analysis
  - Ask questions



## E: Examples and Test Cases

## D: Data Structures

## Algorithm

## Implementing a solution in code

## Sum Even Number Rows:

Imagine a sequence of consecutive even integers beginning with 2. The integers are groups in rows, with the first row containing one integer, the second row two integers, the third row three integers and so on. Given an integer representing the number of a particular row, return an integer representing the sum of all the integers in that row.

- sequence of integers
- sequence begins with 2
- integers are consecutive
- sequence is grouped into rows
- Each row incrementally larger: 1,2,3,...
- Row number given is equal to the number of elements in the Row.
  - Row 1 has 1 element
  - Row 2 has 2 elements
- Input: a single integer
  - Identifies a 'row', which is a subset of a sequence of integers
- Output:
