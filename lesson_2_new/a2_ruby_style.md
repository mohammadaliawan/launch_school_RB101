# Ruby Style

This assignment was about the style conventions used in ruby programming.

1. Editor Settings:

- tabs should be equal to 2 spaces
- convert all existing tabs or indentation to 2 spaces

This is accomplished with:

tab_size: 2
translate_tabs_to_spaces: true

2. Comments start with #

3. methods,variables and files should always be initialized with snake_case formatting.

4. Values that will not change in your program are called constant variables or constants.
They are denoted by all uppercase letters.

```ruby
FOUR = 4
```

5. When working with do...end blocks prefer {} when the entire code can fit on one line.

6. Class names are declared using CamelCase.
