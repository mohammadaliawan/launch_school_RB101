# Order of Precedence:

The order in operators are evaluated is called order of precedence.

tâ€™s a set of rules that dictate how and in what order operators are evaluated in an expression.

The operators with higher levels of precedence are prioritized

**BODMAS works in ruby as well**

Parentheses override the default evaluation order and evaluate the inner expression first without regard to the precedence rules.
