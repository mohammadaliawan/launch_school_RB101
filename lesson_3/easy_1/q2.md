Q: Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

A: `!` in ruby is used for two reasons in ruby. First, its used as the `not` operator. Second, if followed by a method name then it usually means that the method is a mutating method.

The `?` is used in the ternary operator for if..else

! or ? after a method name is part of the method name

! before some obj turns any object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent
