First I am going to read through the problem a few times and understand the test cases provided. Then I am going
deconstruct the problem into its requirements and define the rules and boundaries of the problem.

------ PED:- 0 MIN to 12 MIN --------------


**Input** :
**Output** :

**Explicit Requirements/Rules/Boundaries**
-


**Implicit Requirements/Rules/Boundaries**
-


**Special Terms**

Now I am going to go through the test cases in more detail and map out the high level sequence of manual steps
involved in going from the input to the output
**Examples/Test Cases**
