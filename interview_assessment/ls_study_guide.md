# Study Guide

Areas of Focus
general programming fluency with basic Ruby
ability to problem solve and decompose the problem description into technical concepts
ability to speak clearly and with precision while coding
Live Coding
We'll ask you to code through two small programs from scratch to get a feel for how fluent you are with programming, and get a feel for your thought process. Be familiar with:

working with simple data structures like arrays and hashes
be able to manipulate arrays and hashes very fluently. For example, an exercise might be "reverse an array without using the built-in reverse method", or "select the element out of the array if its index is a fibonacci number", or "write a method to determine if a word is a palindrome, without using the reverse method", etc.
know how to loop and/or iterate over a collection, and know exactly how to control the iteration flow. Specifically, understand when to use next and when to use break.
We won't have a lot of time, so come prepared to code right away. There won't be much time to warm up, so you'll have to warm up beforehand.

The complete interview should take no more than 60 minutes. You are expected to solve both problems within that time frame.

Communication Style
Finally, we're also assessing your ability to communicate clearly. You should speak in a clear tone and you should explain concepts with precision using the correct vocabulary. If you haven't done this before, it's likely you'll need to practice before the interview. There's a reason the previous sentence is in bold. Many students find it helpful to practice this by recording themselves solving exercises and verbalizing their thought process, using QuickTime or another recording tool.

When you make a mistake, we're also looking for how you recover -- or whether you are able to recover at all.

Assessment Prep Videos
We did a Watch Others Code video series in which students work with problems that are on par with the exercises you'll see on the interview. Be sure to watch all parts to get a good feel for what the problems are going to look like and how to approach them.

Problem Solving
One of the core skills we're looking for at this stage is your ability to problem solve and decompose a complicated problem. This requires a systematic approach to tackling an exercise. You should know what the code you write is doing, and you should never enter "let me just run it to see what it will do" mode. You must be in full control of the code, and your process must be intentional and directed, not "hack and slash" or "trial and error".

One of the best ways to become more intentional in the way you approach a problem is by introducing some structure around how you analyze it. See the Introduction to the PEDAC Process and the The PEDAC Problem Solving Process assignments for our recommended problem-solving approach.

Launch School student, Julius, wrote a blog post about his 'interview script' in which he demonstrates his approach to breaking down a code challenge and solving it step-by-step.

Exercises
We created over a hundred Small Problem exercises to help reinforce the concepts up to this point. The interview questions will also be around this caliber. You need to have completed all of them at this point. Try to apply the problem solving approach as you work through these exercises.

RB101-RB109 Small Problems.

Note: if you find the Easy ones difficult, do not schedule an interview as it's almost certain you won't pass. Instead, practice with the Ruby Basics exercises first, and then review the content in RB101. Most of our best students do all of these exercises multiple times.

Study Groups
There are peer led study groups for this assessment on the Community Forums. It's highly encouraged that you attend a session, if schedule allows. Live coding in front of someone is a completely unique experience from practicing alone on your own. You'll need to practice working on exercises, but you'll also need to practice for the interview format as well. Just as you wouldn't want to be surprised on a real job interview, you don't want to feel surprised by your sub-optimal performance during the assessment interview. Many students tell us that attending a study group is one of the best ways to prepare for the interview.

Final Tips
It's probably a good idea to over prepare so you come to the interview ready to impress. It's highly unlikely that you'll perform at your peak during the interview, so make sure to practice and get to a place where you are confident in your ability. Expect to be nervous and expect to be operating at sub-optimal level. But still aim to impress.

Speak with precision and confidence and clarity. To get the most out of this experience, treat this as your first job interview.

We don't allow the use of Ruby documentation on the interview assessment, so don't rely on it.

Don't forget to test your code early and often! The sooner you run some tests, the easier it is to find and fix any bugs in that code.

In this blog post, Nathan shares his advice on how to prepare for the RB109 interview assessment.

In this blog post, Juliette shares her strategies to prepare for the RB109 interview assessment.

In this blog post, Callie shares a wealth of useful information about preparing for both parts of the assessment: the exam and the interview. If you already read it earlier, it's worth reading again.
