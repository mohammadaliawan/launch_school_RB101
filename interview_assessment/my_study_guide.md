# Interview Assessment - My Study Guide


## Read through the Problem statement a few times until you understand the main gist of the problem.
  - while doing this copy/paste parts of the problem into different parts

## Notedown the required input and output.

## Notedown the Explicit requirements

## Notedown the Implicit

## Areas of focus - Things to get good at!

- Fluency in basic Ruby 
- Ability to problem solve - PEDAC
- Ability to Decompose the problem description into technical concepts - PEDAC
- Ability to speak clearly and with precision while coding

## Concepts and Skills:

- Able to manipulate arrays and hashes very fluently

- Able to iterate over a collection 

- Able to control the iteration flow. `next` and `break`

## Communication

- speak in a clear tone and
- explain concepts with precision using the correct vocabulary

When you make a mistake, we're also looking for how you recover -- or whether you are able to recover at all.

## Problem Solve

- ability to problem solve and decompose a complicated problem
- systematic approach to tackling an exercise
- You should know what the code you write is doing
- you should never enter "let me just run it to see what it will do" mode
- You must be in full control of the code
- your process must be intentional and directed, not "hack and slash" or "trial and
error"


One of the best ways to become more intentional in the way you approach a problem is by introducing some structure around how you analyze it.
