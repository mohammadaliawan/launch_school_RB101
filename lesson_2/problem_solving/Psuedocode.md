# Psuedocode

<!-- Find the greatest number in a collection

Given a collection of integers

- save the first value as the starting value
- iterate through the collection of integers one by one
- for each iteration, compare the current integer to the saved integer
- if saved integer is greater or same as the current integer
  - move to the next integer in the collection
- otherwise, save the current number as the saved value

- return the saved number -->

## Load the problem into your brain by first not coding the problem

When you first approach any problem, it's important to try to understand it well. In order to do that, you have to spend time to load the problem into your brain. Only then can you start to dissect it, understand it, and come up with an execution path to solve it.

Therefore, there are two layers to solving any problem:

1. The logical problem domain layer.
2. The syntactical programming language layer.

## Formal Psuedocode

keyword               meaning
START                 start of the program
SET                   sets a variable we can use for later
GET                   retrieve input from user
PRINT                 displays output to user
READ                  retrieve value from variable
IF / ELSE IF / ELSE   show conditional branches in logic
WHILE                 show looping logic
END                   end of the program

## Sophisticated Problems

For more sophisticated problems, we need to take a piecemeal approach to applying pseudo-code, then translating that to Ruby code to verify the logic is correct, then moving on to the next piece in the problem. Step by step, we can slowly load the problem into our brain, verifying the logic each step along the way.
