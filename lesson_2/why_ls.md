Hey Mohammad, 101 took me hundreds of hours and roughly 25% of all of my time in core to date. It's a steep learning curve and it was very discouraging at times. Now, in 215, I'm learning very similar concepts and solving very similar problems, this time in JS. What felt really hard in 101 now feels much easier. Once you are done with 101, you will be surprised at how quickly things move along. But like others have said, its really a good idea to take your time in 101 because it's building your foundation. Don't worry, before you know it you will be looking in the review mirror, back at 101! (edited)

Hi Mohammad, I want to thank you for sharing. I know many students who feel this way sometimes feel alone. It's helpful to see that we're not alone.
I did not have the same kinds of doubts (mine were more personal - "am I able to do this?"), but what you said here really resonated with me: "sometimes it gets very hard for me to keep going." I would not have kept going if it weren't for @Felicia checking in with me regularly, and then what finally got me through to the end of 101 was trying to schedule live coding sessions with other students at least 2x/wk and attending all the TA-led study sessions I could. It was just enough external motivation to get me out of my fear of failure and keep moving forward, even if I sometimes still had bad days. I had always been more of a lone-wolf learner, but taking advantage of the community of support here at LS is what helps me the most when I feel those doubts. (edited)

I understand where your doubts and anxiety is coming from. Many students have experience this too and uncertainty is a reality we have to deal with.
Aside from the job market and things we do not have control over. On the bright side, we do have control over our preparation. We can build our skills and have a solid understanding of the fundamentals. We can set ourselves up for success when the opportunity arises.
Some day when I have a job interview, I feel that my preparation is the most important to me. I want to be able to confidently show my future employer the solid skills I have and really impress them. So they can trust that I can get the job done.
Some things that have helped lower anxiety for me is to do an analysis check on my personal situation and finances by running the numbers. If I am able to meet my needs in the short term and live comfortably while doing LS, then I set aside time as much as I need for LS without feeling guilty. If those feelings pop up again (and they probably will because we're all human and we have emotions), I refer back to my documentation I wrote about "Why I started LS" and remind myself of my initial goals and that everything is OK for me to continue doing LS.

It takes courage to step into the unknown, in doing so you are bettering yourself. As far as costs it may be high for you due to the exchange, however try comparing it to other institutions alongside traveling, material costs etc. LS doesn’t charge international student fees, plus the community here is very supportive. Thank you for sharing your thoughts and being an LS student such as myself. It’s so amazing that we are all learning alongside others from many backgrounds on a global scale. To answer your question personally in times of self-doubt I think of people such as yourself. It’s very inspiring knowing that people are working hard, that gives me courage to muster through and put in the hours (even if progress is slooow at times). Look back at 6 months ago and compare it to where you are now.

All of your comments are really helpful and have given me the courage to keep at it. It helps to know that I am not the only one going through this. I am very grateful. LS really is a community of awesome people. proud to be a part of it. Thanks again.


Hey Mohammad, I would say, Yes, absolutely, I had anxiety and doubts throughout the program. And I still have doubts now. I completed the Core Curriculum with all A+ and A grades, did it in 6 months, never had to retake an exam, and I still doubt whether I can be a professional software engineer. Rationally/intellectually, I know I'm very good at software engineering and in fact I believe I can be an excellent engineer in a few years. I really think I can master this field and be in the top 10% of all engineers in terms of performance. Emotionally, however, I'm scared to death of starting a job and not knowing what to do and freezing at the computer and being stuck and not having anyone to help me and having to quit after a few weeks. The problem is with my emotions. My emotions are way off. They haunt and crippled just about everything I do. The challenge I face is to not let them control my actions. I can control my actions at all times, my thoughts only some of the time, and my emotions almost never. I just have to focus on control my actions. "How would I act right now if I were confident?" So, the challenge for me is to literally drag myself, force myself to complete my work no matter how I'm feeling. Some days I have to lay down on the floor of my office. Some days I sit with my head in my hands for a long time. Some days I make very little progress and just have to survive. But I've decided to keep going. And I'm glad I have. I have many good days. And I've experienced happiness with victory over myself. The most helpful resource for me during this time has been two books - "Maximum Achievement" by Brian Tracy and "Think And Grow Rich" by Napolean Hill. Without those books and doing what they say, I would have quit months ago, and would be doing something like delivering mail or working a low skilled job right now.
