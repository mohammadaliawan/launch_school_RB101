Suppose we have either a string, or an array of any type so of objects(strings, numbers, etc)

Requirement: Count how many of each/ some specific thing(object, char) occures in either the above string or array of objects

Counting some specific character in a string

Given a string:
- clean the string - keep only the valid characters
- Remove duplicates - create a key (array): all the characters only once # ['h','e','l','o']
- Use the above key to iterate and count the occurances of each character

COunting some specific elements in an array [1,2,3]/ [string],[symbols]

- clean the array of elements- keep only the valid elements(also may need to clean the individual ele)
- Remove duplicates - create a key (array): all valid elements only once
- Use the above key to iterate and count the occurances of each elements.
