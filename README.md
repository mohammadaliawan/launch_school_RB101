## RB101

RB101 has two distinct parts
- Problem Solving
- Breaking down and understanding how a programming language works

### Problem Solving:

Lessons:

- Small Problems
- PEDAC - Done
- Large Problems - Done

This part is about how to go about solving a problem
- Understanding a problem and all its requirements and rules, edge cases etc.
- Setting up tests and examples to test our understanding of the problem
- Choosing what Datastructure to use to solve the problem
- And then breaking down the problem into a series of smaller problems.
- And coming up with a simple algorithm to solve the smaller problems and the bigger problem.

### Understanding of a programming Language

Should be able to understand these concepts in the context of the programming language.

What can a programming language do and how does it do it?

- Simple Datastructures (integers, floats, strings)
- Variables, Variable Scope
- Object Passing
- Control Structure
- Method Definitions, Return Values
- Looping
- Collection Data Structures(Strings, Hashes, Arrays)
- idiomatic Methods for different Datastructures
- How do Blocks work in that programming language
- A good vocabulary of the all the important methods in that programming language for important classes.
