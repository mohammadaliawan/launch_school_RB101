=begin

Write a method that returns an Array that contains every other element of an Array that is
passed in as an argument. The values in the returned list should be those values that are in
the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and so on elements of the argument Array.

Examples:

oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [2, 4, 6]
oddities([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [1, 3, 5]
oddities(['abc', 'def']) == ['abc']
oddities([123]) == [123]
oddities([]) == []

**Input** : array
**Output** : array

**Explicit Requirements/Rules/Boundaries**
- write a method
- takes an array as argument
- returns an array with every other element of the given array
- every other means: 1st, 3rd, or 5th positions

**Implicit Requirements/Rules/Boundaries**
- every other means: 1st, 3rd 
  - at indices 0,2,4,6... even indices


**Special Terms**
-


**Examples/Test Cases**
oddities([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) == [2, 4, 6]

select elements at indices 0, 2, 4
