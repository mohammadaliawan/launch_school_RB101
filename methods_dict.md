# Methods to learn

## Arrays

- tally
- group_by
- sort_by

- reverse
reverse → new_array
Returns a new Array with the elements of self in reverse order

- join
join(separator = $,) → new_string

Returns the new String formed by joining the array elements after conversion

- count











## Strings

- split
split(pattern=nil, [limit]) → an_array

Divides str into substrings based on a delimiter, returning an array of these substrings.

If pattern is a String, then its contents are used as the delimiter when splitting str. If pattern is a single space, str is split on whitespace, with leading and trailing whitespace and runs of contiguous whitespace characters ignored.

- reverse

reverse → new_str
Returns a new string with the characters from str in reverse order


- count
